# **Is climate change killing American starfish?**
#### By: Arya Goel
### Introduction:

* In recent years, millions of the starfish, also called sea stars, have had
their legs curl up and pull away from their bodies, breaking the animals to
pieces before they turn to mush, often in a matter of days.
* They are tracking the numbers of stars in locations over time, gauging the
temperature and chemistry of the water, and logging the data as part of ongoing
research into the ecosystem. They are even recruiting "citizen scientists" to
help search for the stars and record their condition.

### Research Question(s):
* Now after seeing the adverse effects of global warming, the primary challenge
faced by researchers is collecting accurate and vast amount of data for good
understanding of what is a happening.
* Is Global warming an actual reason of why Starfish are dying at such a steep
rate or is it because of the water conditions?
